Bubble Combat
=======================

##Overview
A multiplayer Android combat game where 2+ bubbles (players) can fight with each other using touch gestures. Depending on the force and direction applied in the gesture the bubbles will accelerate and inflict damage on each other thus lowering their health. The one who has higher speed will cause more damage on its enemy in case of collision, but will also lower its own health if it misses the oponent and hits some of the special objects (hurdles) on the level.
